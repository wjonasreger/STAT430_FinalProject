    "For this project we wanted to perform an analysis on a dataset that we found interesting but also relevant to our personal lives. We decided to use the \"Movies on Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu and Disney+\" Dataset from Kaggle, which can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney. The Netflix Prize brought more attention to how important recommender systems are and how they may be used in many applications. While algorithms designed to recommend movies, products, or other services to customers are very beneficial to businesses and customers alike, sometimes they can perform poorly due to insufficient data or skewed analysis. Industry practitioners want these recommendations to be fast, simple, and accurate to make it as easy as possible for customers to see it and decide that it's something they want to buy (Technophilo, 2012) Recommendation systems can work very well because they provide customers a way to give their feedback about what they liked or disliked. This feedback helps businesses generate predictions on what other movies or products that the customer is most likely to watch or buy, which can increase the amount of business that is made (Aggarwal, 2016). While our end goal for the project isn't to build a recommendation system, this is a big part of what drew us to this dataset, which contains not just data from Netflix but from three other streaming services as well. We were also excited to find any possible relationships between movie ratings, production details, age, target audience, and streaming services that we may or may not already know. The motivation of someone who would analyze this kind of data more extensively would likely be to build a recommendation system for one of these streaming services or for other movie retailers. These businesses would be able to advertise or recommend movies to customers who would be more likely to watch or pay for it. For instance, Netflix and Prime Video are likely to have a large selection of movies available for all age ratings and would benefit from being able to recommend the best movie for a viewer who prefers 18+ rated Horror and Thriller movies vs another viewer who prefers Comedy and Drama but has no discrimination for age ratings. Another application is to evaluate how well movies in different clusters are rated across different geographic regions, so Netflix could make decisions on what movies to add or remove from different regions of their service. This dataset could even be expanded by including social media ratings and response to movies, movie revenue, how much was watched, and user-specific information that could be more useful for a recommendation system. This kind of data can also be useful to the movie production industry in general since it can help them measure the success of a movie based on ratings, where it's most popular, what genres or other characteristics are trending, and even what streaming service might add the movie to their library. This dataset can also be expanded by including movie rating changes over time to be even more useful for the movie industry (Moon et al, 2010).\n",

    "We retrieved this dataset from Kaggle, which is maintained by Ruchi Bhatia. Part of the data was scraped, which contains attribute information of movies that were available on the streaming platforms. The remaining data came from the IMDb dataset. The Kaggle user was inspired to make this dataset from the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which streaming platform(s) can I find this movie on?\n",
    "2. Average IMDb rating of movies produced in a country?\n",
    "3. Target age group movies vs the streaming \\[platform\\] they can be found on.\n",
    "4. The year during which a movie was produced and the streaming platform they can be found on.\n",
    "5. Analysis of the popularity of a movie vs directors.\n",
    "\n",
    "She provides a link to her own data visualization that answers these questions, but we will not focus on or be limited to these questions for our own analysis. The dataset has 16744 observations (movies) and 17 columns for row index, movie ID, title, year of production, age rating, IMDb rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating, Netflix Dummy Variable (DV), Hulu DV, Prime Video DV, Disney+ DV, Type (movie or tv show), Directors (names), Genres, Country(s) available in, Language(s), and Runtime (movie length). \n",
    "\n",
    "There was no further details including on what if any preprocessing was used, but there may likely have been some binning used since since movies are usually region specific for most if not all platforms. For instance, the movie 'Inception' is listed on Netflix only but might only be available in the United States. Another possible issue is that the 'Country' column could refer to these region specefic availabilities or to where the movie was produced, neither was explicitly stated (similar issues for 'Genres', 'Language', and 'Directors'). We are not sure exactly which attributes come from IMDb or streaming services, but we think it would safe to assume that the attributes we mentioned likely came from the streaming services."

    "The data shown above closely resembles the raw data file given on Kaggle. Although the dataset was briefly described in the introduction of the report, there are still some key features that should be emphasized. First, it is important to note the overall structures of most features in the dataset: categorical. In other words, many of the clustering/unsupervised learning techniques mentioned in class may not yield substantial results, due to the lack of numerical attributes. There are several ways to combat this issue in order to allow the data to be usable for unsupervised learning. One method, which is implemented in this report, is the use of dummy variables. Instead of having strings of data in each column, like types of genres and name of the directors, it may be more helpful to convert those features into numerical, 1s or 0s, data. This process is outlined later in the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis section; however, by doing this, unsupervised learning techniques can be better applied to the dataset. "

    "By importing the dataset into a Pandas dataframe, the summary statistics can be invoked by using the `.describe()` function. Unfortunately, only the numerical features are shown for the summary statistics because the categorical data cannot be described in this way. One thing to note is that the count of each attribute is different, hinting that there may be missing values in the dataset that must be cleansed. Next, the `Netflix`, `Hulu`, `Amazon Prime Video` and `Disney+` columns do not provide valuable insights on each of the parameters. This is mainly due to the fact that those columns are enocded as dummy variables (1s or 0s), meaning that the data shows whether or not an observation has either `Netflix` or no `Netflix`. However, we can see that the average values are quite small for `Netflix`, `Hulu` and `Disney+`, meaning that there are probably very few movies on those streaming platforms within the dataset. On the other hand, `Prime Video` has a value (0.74) relatively close to 1, meaning that most observations are `Prime Video` m. Next, one interesting feature worth noting are the `IMDb` scores of movies. The movies on average have a score of about 5.9, but the standard deviation of the scores is quite large with 1.35. This means that most of the data points in the dataset are between a score of 4.55 and 7.25. Lastly, the `Years` the movies were made spanned a multitude of decades. The oldest movie was made in 1902 and the most recent movie was made in 2020, meaning there is a range of more than 100 years among movies in the dataset. These attributes will provide interesting insights on consumer behavior when unsupervised learning algorithms are applied on the dataset."

    "The output above shows pairwise correlations for features that have a correlation values of greater than 0.4 or less than -0.4. This shows what features are adequately correlated with one another in both the positive and negative directions. Some features, like `Asia` and `Asian`, make sense that they have a large correlation between them, while others, like `Netflix` and `Prime Video`, are much more interesting. For instance, seeing a strong, negative correlation between the 2 streaming platforms means that there is an inverse relationship between movies in both platforms, meaning that for any movie that is on `Prime Video` there is less chance that `Netflix` will have it, and vice versa. Additionally, seeing a correlation between `Animation` and `Family`, and `Disney+` and `Family` is reassuring as it makes sense for those features to have a positive correlation with one another. In other words, it makes sense that animation films as well as films on Disney+ cater to the family genre. It is also worth noting the high correlations between `North America` and `English`, and `North America` and `Asian` as it wouldn't readily make sense for such relationships to be prevalent. Overall, there seems to be some interesting pairwise relationships within the dataset that may be brought into light as unsupervised learning is applied to the dataset."

    "One main issue that was presented in the original dataset was the standard deviation within each feature. Specifically, there seemed to be a large spread among numerical data as well as created dummy variables. Because of this, the dataset was a bit unbalanced and it was much more difficult to derive insights through clustering. To combat this, scaling was applied to the dataset to stabilize the standard deviations of all variables in the dataset. In the table above, most, if not all, features have a standard deviation of about 1, meaning that the dataset was scaled appropriately. "

    "From the analysis above, this dataset is clusterable. The main metric used to deduce the clusterability of the two datasets used in the analysis is the hopkins statistic. After running the algorithm on both datasets, the hopkins statistic provided values ranging from 0.04 and 0.16. The closer the hopkins statistic is to 0, the more clusterable the dataset is, which confirms that both datasets are ready for unsupervised learning. As stated earlier, there are 2 main datasets used in this report: `mdf` and `mdf_cat`. The t-sne plot for `mdf_cat` is shown first and the t-sne plot for `mdf` is shown second. For `mdf_cat`, there seems to be 2 main large clusters with many smaller cluster hovering around it, while `mdf` seems like one large cluster with a few less spherical clusters attached to it. Both clusters seem to have a shape that is approximately spherical with very little separation and cohesion. Additionally, both plots show that the clusters are not balanced in size as some are larger than others, and due to the lack of separation there is a large chance that many of the clusters overlap with one another. Although these plots do not present promising results, the different unsupervised learning algorithms may be able to identify some hidden cluster structures that can shed light on some possible findings in the data."

    "This dataset was heavily dependent on categorical variables with very few numerical attributes. Additionally, there were a large amount of missing data and pre-processing that must be done for the dataset to be usable under any unsupervised modeling. During the processing phase, many of the observations were converted from categorical values to dummy variables as well as encoded into bins and then scaled to be on par with the rest of the features in the dataset. This allowed the dataset to be ready for a categorical based clustering. In fact, this dataset became a perfect specimen for agglomerative hierarchial clustering because of the dummy variables and standardized data. Additionally, since the dataset was categorical heavy, the k-modes algorithm was also chosen to cluster the dataset. Both of these clustering algorithms are known for their efficacy in categorical datasets and tend to give accurate clusterings. This is why they were chosen and implemented in the next section."

    "From the results shown above, several silhouette scores were computed based on 4 different linkages: single, complete, ward and average. From the summary table, it is apparent that the single linkage was the most dominant linkage for the agglomerative hierarchial clustering. These high scores indicate the best linkage option as well as the best number of clusters. Based on the silhouette scores alone, it seem that a single linkage with 2 clusters is perfect for the agglomerative hierarchial clustering algorithm. The next best option was average linkage and then complete linkage. Each linkage has its pros and cons for clustering, so a great next step would be to visualize the most predominant linkages on a t-sne plot over a range of clusterings to see what is the best option for the agglomerative hierarchial clustering."

    "Now moving on to the k-modes clustering algorithm, it is necessary to investigate the optimal number of clusters for the unsupervised learning technique. Since, k-modes is optimal for categorical data, it should be especially effective for clustering this dataset. Using a `for` loop, the costs of the k-modes algorithm can be found for a range of clusters. The costs are then plotted to find the elbow plot shown above. Through several iterations, it was found that the elbow was between 4-6 clusters, hinting that anything in that range should yield positive results for the k-modes algorithm. Hence, for this unsupervised learning technique, 5 clusters were chosen for the k-modes algorithm."

For the most part, the clusters are quite spread out with observations protruding into other cluster groups.

However, overall the clusters seem to be pretty defined and each has a large amount of observations, which could yield insightful results."

    "To start, the first algorithm analyzed for the cluster distances was the agglomerative hierarchial clustering with complete linkage. Since this method is hierarchical clustering, the cophenetic correlation coefficient can be used to determine whether or not the clustering is better for the given dataset. In fact, the euclidean distance matrix was calculated for the given dataset and the cophenetic distances were given using the complete linkage function. Lastly, finding the correlation between the two distance matrices yielded the correlation matrix above. It is apparent that the value outputted from the correlation matrix is quite close to 1, hinting that the dendogram preserves the pairwise distances of the original dataset. Additionally, the average silhouette score of the complete linkage with 5 clusters yielded a value of about 0.35, hinting that the clusters are more cohesive and well separated. This can also be used as a metric to evaluate the cluster distances as more well separated and cohesive clusters means there is larger cluster distances."

    "Unfortunately for k-modes, there does not seem to be a cophenetic correlation coefficient metric that can be used for this unsupervised learning method. Instead, it is better to look at the average silhouette score as well as the silhouette plot, once again. From the average silhouette score, the values is very close to about 0.1. This hints that there is a very average/mediocre amount of cohesion and separation among clusters in the dataset. Hence, the cluster distances among clusters must be on the smaller end of the spectrum as less separation and cohesion makes clusters overlap with one another."

    "From the results throughout this report, it is apparent that the k-modes did a much better job in ascertaining groups within the data than that of the agglomerative hierarchial clustering. In terms of the research motivations, there were a lot of insights that needed to be confirmed. Prior to this analysis, there were a lot of relationships that were intuitive and needed to substantiate with unsupervised learning. For instance, a group that contained the `Disney+` streaming service should also like `family` and `animation` genres and have age groups that are younger. This specific example was better confirmed by the k-modes clustering than that of the agglomerative hierarchial clustering. The research goals of this project was to understand underlying groups within streaming platforms to better understand how to cater to them. By understanding this, reccomendations, like different movie genres, can be made to allow for a more enjoyable viewing experience. Overall, the k-modes algorithm better helped reach the research goals of this analysis and provided informative results."

    "In conclusion, this project provided a variety of insights on not only the dataset, but also the ways in which unsupervised learning methods can be applied and interpretted. In the beginning of the report, an exploratory data analysis as well as a data processing/cleaning phase was necessary to jumpstart the unsupervised learning analysus. First, many descriptive statistics were calculated for all the numerical data in the dataset. From the output, it was evident that there was a large standard deviation among each feature in the dataset. Additionally, with the creation of dummy variables, the standard deviation was quite unbalanced from feature to feature. To combat this, a scaling/stanardizing of the data was completed to ensure a more fair and holistic analysis. Furthermore, some basic pairwise relationships were ascertained to see if there were any correlations between variables of interest. Specifically, there was a strong positive correlation between `Disney+` and the `Family` genre, which makes sense intuitively. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the preliminary exploratory data analysis, the dataset structure was put under scrutiny. The two dataset, `mdf` and `mdf_cat`, were plotted onto a t-sne plot to discover the shape of each dataset. Unfortunately, both datasets seemed to be encompassed by 1-2 clusters and were approximately spherical in shape. Additionally, there was a large imbalance in the size of the clusters with many clusters overlapping with one another. Because of the shape and type of dataset that was being used, two main clustering algorithms were applied to the dataset: agglomerative hierarchial clustering and k-modes clustering. From further analysis using silhouette scores, dendograms, elbow plots and t-sne plots, it was found that using 5 cluster for the k-modes algorithm and using 5 clusters with complete linkage for the agglomerative hierarchial clustering algorithm provided the most optimal results.\n",
    "\n",
    "After choosing the final clustering, the separation and cohesion of the clusters were assessed using the silhouette score and plots. From this analysis, it was found that the agglomerative hierarchial clustering had much better separation and cohesion in comparison to that of the k-modes algorithm. However, this does not mean that hierarchial clustering perfomed better than k-modes. When looking at the cluster attributes, it was apparent that many of the clusterings created by k-modes made sense. In other words, k-modes was much better at identifying streaming platforms as cluster groups, while hierarchial clustering tends to muddle the streaming platforms together. Additionally, some of the cluster in the hierarchial clustering didn't make sense, like having a group that is dominated by both younger and older audiences who watch comedies and documentaries. This doesn't intuitively make sense and it yielded inaccurate results. On the other hand, k-modes provided cluster groups that actually made sense. For instance, there was a `Disney+` cluster group that had younger audiences and had adventure, animation and family genre movies. This result intuitively makes sense and is more accurate. Lastly, looking at the cluster distances of each method, it was apparent that the cluster distances of agglomerative hierarchial clustering were smaller than that of k-modes clustering due to the differences in average silhouette scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, this clustering analysis provided an insightful analysis on the research motivation and shed light on underlying groups within the streaming platforms dataset, which will help cater and reccomend genres to different groups. "
