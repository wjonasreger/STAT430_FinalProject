# STAT 430 Final Project
_Atharv Pathak & W. Jonas Reger_

For this project, we wanted to perform an analysis on a dataset that we found interesting but also relevant to our personal lives. We decided to use the "Movies on Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu and Disney+" Dataset from Kaggle, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney).

Please read our paper report or jupyter notebook, and watch our presentation video to learn more about what we did with this dataset.
